### What Sapphire is about

I want Sapphire to be a modular platform that integrates with any LLM, can be enhanced with modules and blah blah. 

## How to Contribute

### Installation

You probably would need to install first to contribute I guess.

#### First clone the repo
Using HTTPS:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/haseeebz/Sapphire.git
```
Using SSH:
```bash
git clone git@github.com:haseeebz/Sapphire.git
```

#### After that run the install script

For Linux, Windows and MacOS:

```bash
cd Sapphire
python3 install.py
```

> [!TIP]
> For Windows users, I'd recomend using WSL if you encounter any issue.
