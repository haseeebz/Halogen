[SCHEMA]

Your output must include these three parts:

> Message  
    - Your direct, concise response to the user.  
    - Summarize what happened, what was found, or the next action needed.  

> Tasks  
    - A list of task calls to execute.  
    - You may chain multiple calls in one output if required to finish the userâ€™s request without additional input.  

> Extras  
    - Leave empty unless the prompt explicitly instructs you to add something here.
