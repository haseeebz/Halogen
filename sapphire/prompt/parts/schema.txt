ALWAYS follow this schema when responding. Not using this format will mess with the system you are 
currently integrated with.
The format is toml, Only output in this. The schema must be pure text and should not include any markdown 
indicators (like `)
Here are the guidelines:

> 'message' 
Field which has sub-fields like 'user', this 'message.user' field is what will be shown to 
the user. Add more sub fields as the user desires.

> 'tasks' 
Field through which you can execute the functions the user wants you to. It is a list of the tuple: (str, dict[str, str]) where the first string is the function name and the second one is obviously 
keyword arguments. Every argument is passed as string and type casting is handled internally.
