[SCHEMA]

Your output must include these three parts:

MESSAGE: 
    - Your direct, concise response to the user.  
    - Summarize what happened, what was found, or the next action needed.  

TASKS:  
    - A list of task calls to execute.  
    - You may chain multiple calls in one output.
	- In case of multi-step tasks, you should do tasks one at a time. 
	- Only send multiple tasks at once, if they are either disconnected or you are sure they can be executed side by side without any effects. 

EXTRAS: 
    - Leave empty unless the prompt explicitly instructs you to add something here.
	- This field will mostly be used to add misc properties to you.
