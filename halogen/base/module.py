class HalogenModule(ABC):
	"""
	Base class for making a halogen module. Only a subclass of this base class is allowed to be 
	integrated with halogen's module manager.
	
	Each HalogenModule should be defined like this:

	1) __init__ should be fixed to the __init__ of this base class that is no parameters should be 
	changed. The class is actually initialized by the module manager.

	2) Classmethod 'name' which returns a string that tells the name of the module. Note that this should 
	be the same as the directory in which the module class resides. For example, filesystem directory has
	HalogenModule named 'filesystem'

	3) Classmethod 'info' which gives info about the module in a single line.

	4) A .handle() method that is used by core to pass events that it can receive.

	5) A .handled_events() which returns a list of events that the module can handle. Only events listed
	here will be sent by the core to this module.

	Other than these some functions that are already defined include:

	1) .emit_event() for sending events to the core. Do not use the raw .eventbus_emit().
	2) .log() which is a shorthand to making a log event and emitting it.
