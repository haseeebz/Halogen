## What is Sapphire?

Sapphire is a platform that allows you full freedom to:

+ Integrate and use any model, *Local* or *Cloud*.
+ Enhance AI functionality with *Custom Modules*.
+ Do tasks and *Automate* your workflow.
+ Build your *own* assistant, the way you like.

The main goal of Sapphire is to be a modularity-focused AI runtime that could potentially take any LLM and alter it's functionality with custom modules while having the ability to create custom interfaces to communicate with said LLM.
